# ITSC-3135-Project
Semester project for intro to web app design.

For the semester project we were tasked with designing and building a website for a client that showcases our learning from the semester.
I thought to ask the advisors of the Zeta Delta chapter of Kappa Alpha Psi fraternity if they were interested and took the content they had added my own spin to it.
