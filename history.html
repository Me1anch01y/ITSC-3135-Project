              <strong>Elder Watson Diggs</strong> (circa 1883-1947), born in Christian County, Kentucky, was a graduate
              of Indiana State Normal (now Indiana State Teachers College) and Indiana University, the birthplace of
              Kappa Alpha Psi Fraternity. He served as Grand Polemarch for the first six consecutive years of the
              Fraternity's existence. For this and other outstanding contributions to the Fraternity, he was awarded the
              Fraternity's first Laurel Wreath in December, 1924.
            </p>
            <p>
              An educator by profession, he taught in the public schools of Indianapolis, Indiana, where he was elevated
              to a principalship. After his death on November 8, 1947, the name of the school where he taught was
              changed to the Elder Diggs School in his memory. Upon America's entrance into World War I, Diggs resigned
              his principalship to enter the Nation's first Officer's Training Camp at Fort Des Moines, Iowa, and was
              commissioned a lieutenant. After European service with the 368th Infantry, he became a captain in the
              Reserve Officers Training Corps. Diggs was instrumental in having the Indiana Constitution amended to
              permit Negro enlistment in the Indiana National Guard.
